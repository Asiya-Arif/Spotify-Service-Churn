# ðŸŽµ Spotify User Churn Prediction & Behavioral Analysis

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Spotify user churn (whether a user stops using the service) and analyzing behavioral patterns that influence churn. The dataset contains rich user-level information, including demographics, subscription details, listening habits, device usage, and engagement metrics.

By combining exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning models, and user segmentation, this project aims to generate data-driven insights and build a robust churn prediction system.

# ðŸ“Š Results

-Free users show the highest churn rates (~50%+), while Premium users have the lowest.

-High ad exposure strongly correlates with churn.

-Users with high skip rates are more likely to churn.

-Behavioral clusters reveal "loyal power listeners" vs. "casual ad-heavy users".
